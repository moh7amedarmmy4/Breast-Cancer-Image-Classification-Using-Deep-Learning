# Breast-Cancer-Image-Classification-Using-Deep-Learning
A deep learning-based project for classifying breast cancer histopathology images. This project compares the performance of several convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures—including a custom CNN, MobileNetV2, ResNet50, and DenseNet121—on medical image datasets for accurate tumor detection.
